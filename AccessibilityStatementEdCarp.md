## Accessibility statement for Edinburgh Carpentries websites

This accessibility statement applies to the websites related to Edinburgh Carpentries, including the main website at [edcarp.github.io/](https://edcarp.github.io/) and the individual website for each workshop. These websites are run by volunteers mainly from [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk).  


We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. That means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of VoiceOver)

We have also tried to make the website text as simple as possible to understand. However, some of our content is technical, and we use technical terms where there is no easier wording we could use without changing what the text means.

### Customising the website

AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability. This is an external site with suggestions to make your computer more accessible:

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

[The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the [Public Sector Body (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made).

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

The full guidelines are available at:

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Some content provided by third parties has not been tested for accessibility yet, e.g. Powerpoint and PDF files. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content) and potentially the category of criteria under 1.4 (Distinguishable). We aim to fix this as soon as effort becomes available. When we publish new content, we'll make sure that the files meet minimum accessibility standards.

Some parts of the website have very low contrast between foreground and background colours. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum). We aim to fix by *DATE*.

### Disproportionate burden

We are not currently claiming that any accessibility problems would be a disproportionate burden to fix.

### What we're doing to improve accessibility

We will continue to address the accessibility issues highlighted, alongside working to deliver a solution or suitable workaround. Unless specified otherwise, a complete solution or significant improvement will be in place for those items within our control by *insert date here*.

While we are in the process of resolving these accessibility issues, or where we are unable, we will ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is disadvantaged. As changes are made, we will continue to review accessibility and retest the accessibility of this website.
