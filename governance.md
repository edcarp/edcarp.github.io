# Governance for the Edinburgh Carpentries

**This is a draft!**

The Edinburgh Carpentries has two coordinating commiettees:

* **Steering committee**: mainly address strategic issues for the Edinburgh Carpentries and try to promote the Carpentries within the pertinent institutions as well as dealing with subscription with the Carpentires. ***Is there somewhere where one can get more information about this***?
* **Organising committee**: implement the vision of the steering committee and do the day-to-day running of the Edinburgh Carpentries - that is, they arrange or try to facilitate Carpentry workshops, try to source instructors and helpers as well as facilitating the setting up of carpentry workshops by providing tips and advice.

The remainder of this document focuses on the *Organising Committee*. The group is composed a number of volunteers who try to meet once a month. If you would like to be involved please email the chair person. There are two main positions who serve for a year:
